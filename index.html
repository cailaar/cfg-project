    <h2><p>Budapest is bisected by the River Danube. Its 19th-century Chain Bridge connects the hilly Buda district with flat Pest. A funicular runs up Castle Hill to Buda’s Old Town, where the Budapest History Museum traces city life from Roman times onward. Trinity Square is home to 13th-century Matthias Church and the turrets of the Fishermen’s Bastion, which offer sweeping views.</p></h2>

            <p>Getting to Budapest</p>
            <p>Located in the heart of Central Europe, Budapest is relatively easy to get to. The most frequent ways to get to the Hungarian capital is either by plane, train, coach or high-speed ferry from Vienna and Bratislava.
                If you are touring Europe and are planning to visit Prague and Budapest, we recommend flying from Prague to Budapest or the other way around instead of taking the train. If you book your flights in advance, it is cheaper than the train and a lot quicker, since the train between both cities takes seven hours.</p>
