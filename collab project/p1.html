        <p>Krakow is one of my favourite cities in the world for many reasons. It is still slightly undiscovered if you compare it to other popular tourist destinations, such as Prague or Paris.  It’s very cheap for anyone traveling with a strong currency, like dollars, pounds, or euros. And the public transportation system here is amazing!  It is easy to understand, clean, safe; and can help you navigate the city and surrounding areas with ease.  However, the city is completely walkable! Meaning you may not have to even step on a bus or tram your whole visit!  All the major sights can be seen in a day by foot without feeling rushed.  But as you will see here, there is far more to Krakow then just Wawel Castle and the Main Market Square.</p>

        <h3>Top 4 things to do in krakow</h3>

       <p> Nowadays, Krakow has become the new trendy hot spot for travelers to visit in Central Europe and for good reasons. Unlike Warsaw, even though Krakow is a big city, being there will make you feel like you are in a warm, closely-knitted neighborhood. The charming little district of the Jewish Quarter (Kazimierz), the stunning Wawel Cathedral surrounded by the Vistula river, and the colorful St. Mary's Basilica, there is no shortage of things to see in Krakow.</p>

       <h3> 1. Explore Kazimierz </h3>

        <p>Kazimierz (the Jewish Quarter) is probably one of my favorite places in Krakow. With its chill vibe, laid-back culture and liveliness of the neighborhood, You can spend an entire day, just by exploring Kazimierz, so take your time, and give yourself a day to enjoy this wonderful neighborhood.</p>

      <h3>2. Eat Your Way Through Kazimierz</h3>

      <p>One of the most interesting parts of traveling abroad is the food and Kazimierz have everything you crave for. Are you craving for street food? Do not worry, Kazimierz has plenty for you to choose from.You can try the best zapiekanka (baguette sandwich) in the country at the New Square on Plac Nowy street where you can choose your own toppings and it is served to you fresh and hot from the oven.</p>
      
      <p>If you are short on time, I highly recommend you go with the Delicious Kazimierz Food Tour from Krakow tour instead as it will save you time and the guide will take you around Kazimierz and try all sorts of street food all in one go.</p>

      <h3>3. Explore The Old Town (St Mary Basilica And More)</h3>

      <p>Step into the Fairy-tale-like Old Town Square of Krakow and admire all the old architecture like the St Mary Basilica, the Town Hall Tower, and the Kraków Barbican. Go down the Florianska tourist street and experience the liveliness of the city in full swing.</p>

      <p>If you are there in the summer months, you might be able to participate in many activities organized in the Old Town Square like a flea market or street food market as well.</p>

      <p>You can climb up one of the towers of St Mary Basilica for a grand view of Krakow and the Old Town Square. If you climb up there at the right time, you will be able to witness the old tradition of St. Mary's Trumpet Call where a trumpeter on the tower will come out and play the five-note Polish anthem on the hour every hour, 4 times on each side of the tower.</p>

      <h3>4.Walk Around The Wawel Cathedral</h3>

      <p>Wawel castle is one of the most important landmarks in Krakow, and a must visit when you are in the city. The architecture of Wawel castle is a mixture of Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, and Early Baroque due to it being occupied and captured by different rulers over its existence. I recommend you spending at least a few hours there to learn more about its importance among the Polish people.
    </p>

    <p>The best place for the best view of the Wawel castle is from the Grunwald Bridge across the Vistula river, south of the castle. During the day, you will see plenty of people walking around the river, and you will be able to get a clear view of the castle in its entirety while at night, the reflection of artificial lights on the river added to the mystical and magical feel of the castle.</p>
